***MOD_TOP2013.f90*** WAS MODIFIED BY YUJIE WANG ON 2023/04/14.

1) TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOLLOWED WHEN USING MOD_TOP2013. 
1.1) Clause of non-responsibility 
            (i) The software has been tested in detail, but can not guarantee 
            compatibility with all systems, can not guarantee that the 
            software is completely free of errors.  If incompatibilities 
            and errors occur, please contact the author.
            (ii) The author cannot be held responsible for any damages 
            and risks, direct or indirect, resulting from the use of this software.
1.2) The origin of the MOD_TOP2013 of your derived work must not be 
            misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the 
            original software, nor file a patent application for 
            MOD_TOP2013 or algorithms embedded in MOD_TOP2013.
1.3) You must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, 
            and giving a relevant date.  The entire risk as to the quality 
            and performance of your modification is with you. 
1.4) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source distribution 
            and shall apply to anyone to whom you have granted a further 
            right to modify the source code of your derived work.


2) The module MOD_TOP2013 is taken from TOP2013 solutions 
       (https://ftp.imcce.fr/pub/ephem/planets/top2013/), and refers to Simon et al. (2013) 
       'New analytical planetary theories VSOP2013 and TOP2013'.  
Changes have been made as following:

2.1) The original main program was modified into a module, NAMED "MOD_TOP2013", and a subroutine, 
       NAMED "JUPITERPV(t,r2)", where r2 in the original code represents the motion vector 
       in heliocentric coordinate system with ICRF, IS CREATED.
       The subroutine TOP2013 and the subroutine ELLXYZ KEEP INTACT.

2.2) To keep consistency with other modules, the precision has been changed using our 
       precision module MOD_PRECISION; All the commands were changed from lowercase to uppercase.

2.3) Because we just focus on the motion of Jupiter at a single time,  
       the selection for four outer planets in Line 21, the creation of a new file in Line 23, 
       and the given time span in Lines 25-30 of original code were deleted.  Lines 62-65 of 
       original code are used to compute the motion of four outer planets using the do loop.  
       It was also modified with a specific body, i.e., Jupiter, corresponding to ip=5.  
       Line 79 of original code controlling the output to the file was deleted.

2.4) Lines 86-97 of original code are the format of output, including the coordinate systems, 
       the precision, and different solutions. which is also deleted because we just need 
       the position and velocity of Jupiter in EQUATORIAL heliocentric coordinate system with ICRF, 
       as input to other modules.

3) The terms and conditions of the original code, TOP2013 solutions, are not found for some reasons.
   If there is any infringement, please contact the author.
